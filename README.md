# OCR for Regional Languages

This OCR Web Application is a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text translation. Users can upload an image containing text, and the application will automatically extract the text using easyocr. The extracted text can then be translated to English using googletrans, and an audio file for the translated text is generated with gTTS. The application offers a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and immediate results.
